#Introduction

\#Biography 

I am Clara Moreno Sanchez, a young professional looking to gain new skills in data analytics and its application to solve important issues in business. I have an academic background in Accounting and Supply Chain Management and a professional background in White-Collar Crime Consulting.

\#\#Some things I like to do during my free time:

1.  Yoga
2.  Go out dancing
3.  Read (I am very fond of poetry) - attached is a poem from one of my favorite poets: ![Screen Shot 2021-08-30 at 4.39.48 PM](/Users/claramoreno/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-30%20at%204.39.48%20PM.png)

I am looking forward for a **great** year at London Business School, and to meet and learn from everyone around me.

# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "Spain") 

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Europe")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}

plot1 + labs(title = "Spain Life Exp Plot", x="Average Life Expactency", y="Year")

```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from. (Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp , colour = 'country', group = 'country'))+
geom_point() + 
facet_wrap(~country) +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
labs(title="Life Expectancy for Countries", x= "Year", y="Average Life Expectancy") +
NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= 'continent'))+
geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
facet_wrap(~continent) +
theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends +
labs(title="Life Expectancy for Continents", x= "Year", y="Average Life Expectancy") 
NULL
```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Type your answer after this blockquote.

Life expectancy has been increasing throughout the world since the 1950s but in different rates when looking at different countries and continents. For example, the African continent has been able to increase its life expectancy, but at a slower rate than the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Interestingly, within continents there is also a lot of disparity in life expectancy at the country level.  

# Task 3: Brexit vote analysis

We will have a look at the results of the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK. First we read the data using `read_csv()` and have a quick glimpse at the data

```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
brexit_results <- read_csv(here::here("data","brexit_results.csv"))


glimpse(brexit_results)
```

The data comes from [Elliott Morris](https://www.thecrosstab.com/), who cleaned it and made it available through his [DataCamp class on analysing election and polling data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r).

Our main outcome variable (or y) is `leave_share`, which is the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit, or leaving the EU. Each row is a UK [parliament constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies).

To get a sense of the spread, or distribution, of the data, we can plot a histogram, a density plot, and the empirical cumulative distribution function of the leave % in all constituencies.

```{r brexit_histogram, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# histogram
Histogram <- ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5) 
Histogram + labs(title="Brexit Leave Results 2015 - Histogram", x= "Percent of Leave Votes", y="Constituencys")

# density plot-- think smoothed histogram
Density_plot <- ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_density()
Density_plot + labs(title="Brexit Leave Results 2015 - Density Plot", x= "Percent of Leave Votes", y="Constituencys")

# The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) 
ECDF <- ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
ECDF + labs(title="Brexit Leave Results 2015 - ECDF", x= "Percent of Leave Votes", y="Constituencys") 


```

One common explanation for the Brexit outcome was fear of immigration and opposition to the EU's more open border policy. We can check the relationship (or correlation) between the proportion of native born residents (`born_in_uk`) in a constituency and its `leave_share`. To do this, let us get the correlation between the two variables

```{r brexit_immigration_correlation}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %>% 
  cor()
```

The correlation is almost 0.5, which shows that the two variables are positively correlated.

We can also create a scatterplot between these two variables using `geom_point`. We also add the best fit line, using `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`.

```{r brexit_immigration_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Brexit Leave Results Per Constituency (2015)", x= "Percent of People Born in the UK", y="Percent of Leave Votes")
  NULL
```

You have the code for the plots, I would like you to revisit all of them and use the `labs()` function to add an informative title, subtitle, and axes titles to all plots.

What can you say about the relationship shown above? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Type your answer after, and outside, this blockquote.

> Although there is variability in the correlation between percent of people born in the uk per constituency and the percent of leave votes, the plot shows a positive relationship between the two. Interestingly, one can see a threshold form around the 90% mark. Constituencys that have ~90% or more people who were born in the UK were the ones who had the greatest amounts of leave votes. The correlation is much weaker below the ~90% mark. This can be due to the case that areas with even just a little immigration (more than 10% of the population are immigrants) are much less likely to follow this pattern. 

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

[The London Fire Brigade](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress. The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries.

Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

```{r load_animal_rescue_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/8a7d91c2-9aec-4bde-937a-3998f4717cd8/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"

animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```

One of the more useful things one can do with any data set is quick counts, namely to see how many observations fall within one category. For instance, if we wanted to count the number of incidents by year, we would either use `group_by()... summarise()` or, simply [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html)

```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")

```

Let us try to see how many incidents we have by animal group. Again, we can do this either using group_by() and summarise(), or by using count()

```{r, animal_group_percentages}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  #group_by and summarise will produce a new column with the count in each animal group
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))


```

Do you see anything strange in these tables? 
> Yes, there is repeated variables due to inconsistency in the data provided.

Finally, let us have a look at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals. As the LFB says,

> Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

There is two things we will do:

1.  Calculate the mean and median `incident_notional_cost` for each `animal_group_parent`
2.  Plot a boxplot to get a feel for the distribution of `incident_notional_cost` by `animal_group_parent`.

Before we go on, however, we need to fix `incident_notional_cost` as it is stored as a `chr`, or character, rather than a number.

```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

# we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)
```

Now that incident_notional_cost is numeric, let us quickly calculate summary statistics for each animal group.

```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
   # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(count)

```

Compare the mean and the median for each animal group. waht do you think this is telling us? Anything else that stands out? Any outliers?
> The mean and mediam for each animal group can tell us how expensive a rescue attempt is for each animal type. We can see that Horses are the most expensive as they have both the highest mean and medium. However, their standard deviation is large so we know that there is a lot of variability in the amount it costs for each individual rescue. The rest of the types of animals have pretty similar medians and modes. 

Finally, let us plot a few plots that show the distribution of incident_cost for each animal group.

```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

Which of these four graphs do you think best communicates the variability of the `incident_notional_cost` values? Also, can you please tell some sort of story (which animals are more expensive to rescue than others, the spread of values) and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> I think the density plot best communicates the variability of the incident national costs. The continous line helps the human eye follow the amounts in costs and it's slope is pronounced and clear. 

> When looking at what animals are more or less expensive to rescue it is important to look at both the variability of the min and max amount it costs and the variability in the density. Some animals like dogs usually cost less then 500 GDB to rescue, but there are rare times where it can cost up to 2,000. Looking at the data more generally however, Horses are the most expensive rescue.
